  <h3>Blog Post 1: Thoughts on "The Pragmatic Programmer"</h3>
  <p>
    In Chapter 1 of "The Pragmatic Programmer", the section that stood out to me the most was 
    section 2, "Software Entropy".  As described in the beginning of this section, "Entropy is
    a term used in physics that refers to the amount of disorder in a system." Being a physics
    major and knowing what entropy is, I thought this was an interesting way to describe the
    idea of disorder.  The increase of disorder in software is referred to as "software rot",
     which I thought was another interesting way to describe disorder in general when working 
     on a group project.  Being a junior, I have ABSOLUTELY experienced software rot (especially
     in Data Structures & Algorithms, as well as Networking). </p>

     Later on in this section, something called the "Broken Window Theory" was introduced.  This 
     is described as something implemented in "...police departments in New York and other major 
     cities to crack down on the small stuff in order to keep out the big stuff."  Connecting this 
     to software jargan, the broken windows represent bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code.
       This idea of the "Broken Window Theory" is interesting to me; it is easy to connect this idea 
       to precautions in things like choosing the theme of the project, what data structures to use, 
       how to implement various things to make the project work, etc.  The imagery in these examples 
       allow me to better visualize the metaphor and learn how it is relavent to the process of working 
       on a group software project. </p>
