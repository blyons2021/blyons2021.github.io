  <h3>Homework Assignment 2: Stories and Features (1/27/2020)</h3>
  <p>In lecture, we discussed the example of developing a platform for volunteers and administrators
  to perform various tasks, relating to the events needing volunteers (i.e., adding a calendar
  to look at upcoming events and a list of volunteers volunteering at a certain event, along with their
  roles.  One of the most important features of this software would be the calendar.  Two 
  stories (or testable, deliverable parts of a feature) of the calendar feature are changing how
  the calendar is formatted (from grid to list, and vise versa) and linking the page of the event
  to the calendar (so that when the name of the event is clicked on, it goes to the page of the 
  event). </p>
  
  <p>The first schematic of the calendar is shown below:</p>
  <img src="volunteer_calendar.JPG" class="inline"/>
  <p>This schematic shows the calendar of events.  When a date is selected, the volunteer events
  for that day will be displayed in a list, just to the right of the calendar.  The event name also
  shows the time(s) of the event.  This will allows users to see the events happening on a certain
  day while not being overwhelmed with ALL off the events going on in that month.  Having a setup
  like this allows for users to select events based on their needs (in this example, this would be 
  an event within their availability).  The user will then click on the title of the event to go to
  the event page.</p>
  
  <p>The second schematic, of the event page, is shown below:</p>
  <img src="volunteer_page.JPG" class="inline"/>
  <p>This schematic lays out the event page.  The title of the event also includes the time and
  date of the event.  In the event description, it includes the name of the location, as well as the address,
  that the event will be held.  It also includes a short description of the event itself and what roles
  are needed.  There is a chart on the right-hand side of the page displaying the names of volunteers, 
  as well as the role of each person at the event.  Finally, beneath this chart, is a link to the signup page.</p>
  
  <p>Questions to consider:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
    <li>Will users be able to seamlessly navigate through the UI?</li>
    <li>How intricate should the connections between pages? (i.e., linking each page to 
      one another in addition to the home page, etc)</li>
  </ul>
