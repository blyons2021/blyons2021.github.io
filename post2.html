  <h3>Blog Post 2: Stories and Features (1/27/2020)</h3>
  <p>In lecture, we discussed the example of developing a platform for volunteers and administrators
  to perform various tasks, relating to the events needing volunteers (i.e., adding a calendar
  to look at upcoming events and a list of volunteers volunteering at a certain event, along with their
  roles.  One of the most important features of this software would be the calendar.  Two 
  stories (or testable, deliverable parts of a feature) of the calendar feature are changing how
  the calendar is formatted (from grid to list, and vise versa) and linking the page of the event
  to the calendar (so that when the name of the event is clicked on, it goes to the page of the 
  event). </p>
  
  <p>The first schematic of the calendar is shown below:</p>
